# Basic-HTML-CSS-

Basic HTML and CSS programs teaching how to used navigation, containers, padding, wrapping etc.

Initially started with several HTML5 files, along with a starter CSS file. My main task was to make the site aesthetically pleasing, functional, and significantly different from the starting state simply by modifying the CSS file. In particular modified colors, fonts, layout, margins, background and more. In at least some places, different parts of the document have different characteristics. Main focus was being able to do all of this without modifying the .html files at all.
